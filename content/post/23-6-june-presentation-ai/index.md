### June Presentation

At the lab where I do my research, the [BYU NET Lab](https://netlab.byu.edu), we have a monthly meeting where students get to share how their projects are going and specific individuals are able to present on various topics. While during the school year we focus on project statuses, in the summer our lab meetings presentation topics are often much more varied. I was asked to present in the June meeting, and I thought that i could share some of those thoughts in my blog.

For my presentation, I decided to share research and thoughts on three distinct topics of emerging technology - Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, and Web3.0. Each of these topics will receive their own blog post so that I can pace myself better and share more thoughts per concept. As such, this si the first of a three part series for my June 2023 Presentation.
