[{"content":"This is my Hello World\nHello World! This is my first (okay, like my third today) attempt at making a personal website using Hugo and the Stack theme! Let\u0026rsquo;s see if this page gets to stick around ;)\nJun 28 Update Hello world, my name is Bryson Schiel, and you can find more about me here. I am creating this blog to follow the advice of Dr. Matt Might (see point 11 on this site). As a PhD student (and future PhD graduate ðŸ¤ž), I will have plenty of opportunities to write and communicate. With that in mind, I suppose that I should then become at least somewhat competent at things like writing and communicating - ergo, the need for a space where I can practice these skills and even let myself flounder a bit on my path to becoming the best I can be in the field.\nThanks for joining me on this journey! I hope that I can provide you as a reader with some good insights or at least a good laugh here or there ;)\n","date":"2023-06-12T00:00:00Z","image":"http://localhost:1313/p/hello-world/hello_world_hu94d502ba8849073a5805baace8b2acc9_19688_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"}]
