# A Bit About Bryson

## TL;DR / Abstract / A Brief Intro to Me Now

As you can see on the homepage, I'm a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECEn). I'm attending Brigham Young University (BYU), where I got my BS degree in Computer Engineering. My current research lies in the field of networking devices, both wired and wireless. You can see more about what our lab at BYU is doing [here](https://netlab.byu.edu).

During my undergrad years, I took classes that trained me in embedded systems and FPGA usage, learning about digital logic all along the way. My current skill-set includes C/C++, Python, Verilog/SystemVerilog, some java, and recently I've been dabbling in Python.

My most recent work has involved automating testing software that evaluates V2X equipment. You can read more about it [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10136347). I got to present on this at [IEEE's 2023 Vehicular Networking Conference](https://ieee-vnc.org/2023/). Currently I'm expanding that testing framework to evaluate additional elements of V2I equipment.

## Beginnings

I grew up near Seattle, Washington. I've always loved the Pacific Northwest, and I couldn't be prouder of where I come from. While the school year was usually busy with class, clubs, and the occasional sport, my family loved to spend our summers having fun in Washington's beautiful outdoors. I'm a huge fan of canoeing, kayaking, crabbing, camping, and so on. I was an active member of my Boy Scouts of America troop and even earned the rank of Eagle Scout at age 15, later on earning the Silver Palm before leaving high school.

Growing up, I had a lot of opportunities to use computers for school and personal activities. (I loved making slideshows especially, after learning about those in early elementary school!) Later on, I started to understand more about the inner workings of computers, and I jumped at chances to learn more through programs like MIT's Scratch and classes about computer technology and programming. While plenty of topics in school fascinated me, I was excited to see how computer science came almost naturally. In my junior year I took AP computer Science and was part of a team that competed in (though, more like attended ðŸ™ƒ) a Hunt the Wumpus competition at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond.

While still in middle school, I learned about computer engineering from a scoutmaster who had gotten his PhD in ECEn at BYU as well. At the time, he was working at Microsoft, and as pat of a scouting merit badge requirement, I got to shadow him at work. That just about sealed the deal for me. I had figured by that point that I wanted to do something with computers, and I liked the balance that I would get to strike between software and hardware as a computer engineer.

By the time I left home for BYU, I already had my major declared, and I couldn't wait to start a whole new journey.

## Undergrad Years

I attended BYU as an undergrad from 2016-2022 (with a two-year break for a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2017-2019). During this time, I took classes that covered a wide variety of computer topics: from embedded systems, electrical circuits, FPGAs and digital logic, to commons CS classes like data structures and app development. One fun example is building a simple RISC-V processor on an FPGA and using it to run an Atari-style game written in [assembly](https://github.com/schielb/galaga323/blob/master/galaga.s).

While working on these class assignments, two of my classmates and I started to sprinkle in side projects together. We worked on a quad copter, a robotics competition, and an automated fan. These allowed me to gain experience with creating a simple computer system for an isolated project.
