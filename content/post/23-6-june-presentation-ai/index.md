### June Presentation

At the [lab where I do my research](https://netlab.byu.edu), we have a monthly meeting where students get to share how their projects are going and specific individuals are able to present on various topics. While presentations during the school year focus on project statuses, in the summer our lab meetings' presentation topics are often much more varied. I was asked to present in the June meeting, and I thought that I could share some of those thoughts in my blog.

For my presentation, I decided to share research and thoughts on three distinct topics of emerging technology - Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, and Web3.0. Each of these topics will receive their own blog post so that I can pace myself better and share more thoughts per concept. As such, this is the first of a three part series for my June 2023 Presentation.

I should also point out that I tried to focus less on the technical details of each of these technologies and more on societal impact and reception. I am far from the most researched individual in the fields, but I hope that these posts serve as a good introduction and launchpad for further exploration.

# Artificial Intelligence

## Historical Origins

Computing machines have a number of origins over the last 200 or so years, from Ada Lovelace' and Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine to Alan Turing's first Turing Machine. It wasn't until after World War II, though, that these machines gained real traction in terms of being used to assist in major scientific, economic, and geopolitical campaigns, all while receiving major investment from business and government alike. Throughout the conception and adoption of these machines, many notable people asked existential questions about the potential of these devices (Lovelace, for example, pondered the role that Babbage's analytical engine could play in things like musical creation). 

One major question in the mid twentieth century was, "Can these machines be taught to think and talk like a human?" More specifically, Alan Turing's famous Turing Test proposed that, if a computer could carry on a conversation with a human that was indistinguishable from a conversation with another human, then the computer could be considered "intelligent". This question and others by scientists eventually led up to the [Dartmouth Workshop of 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop), where the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially established.
