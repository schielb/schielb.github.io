This is my Hello World
<!--more-->


# Hello World!

This is my first (okay, like my third today) attempt at making a personal website using Hugo and the Stack theme! Let's see if this page gets to stick around ;)

## Jun 28 Update

Hello world, my name is Bryson Schiel, and you can find more about me [here]({{< ref "/about" >}} "A Bit About Bryson"). I am creating this blog to [follow the advice of Dr. Matt Might](https://matt.might.net/articles/grad-student-resolutions/) (see point 11 on this site). As a PhD student (and future PhD graduate ðŸ¤ž), I will have plenty of opportunities to write and communicate. With that in mind, I suppose that I should then become at least somewhat competent at things like writing and communicating - ergo, the need for a space where I can practice these skills and even let myself flounder a bit on my path to becoming the best I can be in the field.

Thanks for joining me on this journey! I hope that I can provide you as a reader with some good insights or at least a good laugh here or there ;)
